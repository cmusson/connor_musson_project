This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

- The following app is made entirely in the new experimental NextJS 13 App layout with all server components.
- A user can see all the information and quotes found in each LOTR film and from there select any character to view their information and all their quotes.
- Fully responsive fro both desktop and mobile.

## Getting Started

First, npm install.

Next, npm run dev.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

- Thank you for the opportunity and I look forward to all feedback.
